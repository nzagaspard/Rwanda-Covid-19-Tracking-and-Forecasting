# Rwanda Covid-19-Tracking and Forecasting
 
This application uses the daily Coronavirus updates provided by the Rwanda's Ministry of Health and provide the summary, distribution, growth, and trends of cases in interactive way. It also provide links to some recent news gathered from the NewsApi. I am planning to add the section which shall help to predict/forecast new cases for several days ahead.

The live (web) application can be found [here](https://nzagaspard-rwanda-covid-1-rwandacovidtracker-forecasting-qysmp5.streamlit.app)
